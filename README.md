## System requirements

### For the data analysis part following software/resources are needed:

- R Studio (with Internet access, R Markdown resources like knitr, latex...)
- R packages (not complete): tidyverse, viridis, broom, lubridate
- Texteditor (normal TextEdit is enough, but you can look for more advanced editors)
- MS Excel (sometimes), MS Word or word processor (to write report)
- Basic R knowledge (read/write data, plotting, install packages, R Studio handling, basic statistics with R)
- Internet access is really important (eduroam Wi-Fi).

### For the (Geo)-databases part the following software is needed:

QGIS version 2.14 or 2.18 (https://qgis.org/de/site/forusers/download.html). QGIS is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

On top you will need a software for managing PostgreSQL database servers. There are two options:

pgAdminIII (Caution: not pgAmin4!!!!). For Windows/Mac: https://www.pgadmin.org/download/ ; Linux userswill find pgAdminIII in the software repositories of Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS/Redhat/Fedora and OpenSuse, always called 'pgadmin3'
DataGrip: This is the preferred software, but it is a proprietary chargeable software. For students it is free, in case you register using a university mail adress. DataGrip is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. 
DataGrip is way more powerful than pgAdmin, but not open Source. You can accomplish the lecture with both products.

Furthermore a Github (https://github.com) Account is of great advantage. If you do not yet have an account, you can register immediately. Independent of this lecture the usage of github or any other VCS (Version Control system) is highly recommended. A more or less professional usage of R is hardly imaginable without VCS. The usage of git will be introduced very quickly in the second week.
