## System requirements

### For the data analysis part following software/resources are needed:

- R Studio (with Internet access, R Markdown resources like knitr, latex...)
- R packages (not complete): tidyverse, lubridate, rio, zoo,...
- Texteditor (normal TextEdit is enough, but you can look for more advanced editors)
- MS Excel (sometimes), MS Word or word processor (to write report)
- Basic R knowledge (read/write data, plotting, install packages, R Studio handling, basic statistics with R)
- Internet access is really important (eduroam Wi-Fi).

### For the (Geo)-databases part the following software is needed:

QGIS version 2.14 or 2.18 (https://qgis.org/de/site/forusers/download.html). QGIS is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
On top you will need a software for managing PostgreSQL database servers. There are two options:
pgAdminIII (Caution: not pgAmin4!!!!). For Windows/Mac: https://www.pgadmin.org/download/ ; Linux userswill find pgAdminIII in the software repositories of Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS/Redhat/Fedora and OpenSuse, always called 'pgadmin3'
DataGrip: This is the preferred software, but it is a proprietary chargeable software. For students it is free, in case you register using a university mail adress. DataGrip is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. 
DataGrip is way more powerful than pgAdmin, but not open Source. You can accomplish the lecture with both products.
